I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're in a git repository at `/app` with some untracked files and directories. I'm here to:\n\n1. **Explore your codebase** - Read files, search for patterns, understand architecture\n2. **Design implementation plans** - Create detailed strategies for new features or changes\n3. **Identify critical files** - Point you to the key files needed for implementation\n\n**Important**: I operate in READ-ONLY mode. I can explore and plan, but I cannot create, modify, or delete any files. All actual implementation will need to be done by you or another tool.\n\nWhat would you like to explore or plan today? You can provide:\n- Requirements for a new feature\n- A problem you'd like to solve\n- An area of the codebase you'd like me to analyze\n- A design perspective you'd like me to apply\n\nI'm ready when you are!","thinking":"","signature":"","data":"","id":"","name":"","tool_use_id":"","content":null}],"usage":{"input_tokens":981,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":219}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"8307a157-0a21-4128-bb7f-e8ca7d767c1b","timestamp":"2025-12-04T02:40:45.023Z"}
